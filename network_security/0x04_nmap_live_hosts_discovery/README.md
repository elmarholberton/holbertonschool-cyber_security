0. Will arp be enough ?
mandatory
Write a bash script that scan a subnetwork to discover live host using ARP scan.

You should use nmap.
Your code should tell nmap not to do a port scan after host discovery.
You should run your code as privileged user. root or sudoers.
Your script should accept a subnetwork as an arguments $1.
Depending on the scanned subnetwork, the output could change.
We can‚Äôt expect to learn about the Target MAC Address, unless we are in the the same subnetwork.
