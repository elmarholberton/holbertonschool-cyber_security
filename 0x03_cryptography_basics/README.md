Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
All your scripts will be tested on Kali Linux.
All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
You must substitute the IP range for $1.
All your files should end with a new line (Why?)
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash.
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
You are not allowed to use backticks, &&, || or ;.
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
All your files must be executable
warning
Please ensure to consistently use lowercase format when referring to cryptographic algorithms such as sha256, or any other algorithm.
Tasks
0. SHA1
mandatory
Write a bash script that hashes a given password

You should use SHA-1 algorithm
Your script should accept a password as an arguments $1
The resulting hash must be stored in 0_hash.txt
Depending on the given password, the output could change
