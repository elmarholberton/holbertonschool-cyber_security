Your mission is to determine which subdomain contains a web application with an insecure file upload feature.
This task requires you to methodically explore each subdomain, looking for any interfaces or functionalities that allow file uploads.
Identifying the correct subdomain sets the stage for deeper vulnerability analysis in subsequent tasks.

Target Machine: Cyber - WebSec 0x05
Main Domain: http://web0x05.hbtn
Example:
$ cat 0-target.txt
up3l0d3r.web0x05.hbtn
Useful Instructions 
1. Consider using automated tools like subdomain enumeration tools or web crawlers to quickly identify which subdomains host web applications with upload features.
2. For each subdomain that hosts an upload feature, manually inspect the page and attempt a benign file upload (e.g., a simple text file) to understand how the application processes uploads.
3. Keep detailed notes on your findings for each subdomain, including the types of upload features found and any immediate indicators of potential vulnerabilities.
