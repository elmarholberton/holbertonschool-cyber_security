1 . Sitemap Exploration

Start by reviewing the sitemap located at /sitemap.xml. The sitemap may reveal unusual or hidden routes not linked from anywhere else on the site.

One of these routes contains your flag.

2 . Additional Discovery

Investigate any common files such as robots.txt or favicon.ico, as they may contain further clues or hidden paths.

Useful Instructions
1.Start by navigating to /robots.txt. Look for any Disallow entries that might hint at hidden or restricted paths. These paths could lead to interesting or hidden resources.
2.Access /sitemap.xml. Sitemaps are used to help search engines index web content, but they may also reveal hidden resources. Find the resource that is not linked from anywhere else on the site to discover your flag.
3.Download the site's favicon.ico and analyze it using tools or online resources like the OWASP favicon database. By matching the favicon to known frameworks, you might uncover more information about the site.
4.Pay close attention to details in each file. Each file could contain direct paths or subtle hints that lead to the next step in your discovery process.
5.Utilize online tools for favicon analysis and comparison to help identify the framework and speed up your search for hidden resources.
